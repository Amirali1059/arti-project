# arti-project
mobile phones usually don't have so much computational power, but most of assistnt programs are made for mobile phones with limited abilities, in this project we are going to make a pc assistant using artificial intelligence that can use much more computational power to be so smart.
# what can it do?
using the power of artificial intelligence it can:
 - work offline unlike most of assistants
 - be programmable to do new things, using add-ons that can be installed simply
 - be generative in speaches do not repeatedly say some programmed sentences
 - have a face that can presents feelings (maybe?)
 - learn the accent or personality of the user to be accurate in commands (maybe?)
-------------
afterall it might not be able to run smoothly in all computers but you can make sure its smarter than every other assistants and someone may actually use it in common unlike most assistant programs.
