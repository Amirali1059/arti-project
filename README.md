# arti-project
mobile phones doesn't have so much computational power, but most of assistnt programs are made for mobile phones, in this project we are going to make a smart windows assistant using artificial intelligence.
# what can it do?
using the power of artificial intelligence it can:
 - work offline unlike most of assistants
 - be programmable to do new things, using add-ons that can be installed simply
 - be generative in speaches do not repeatedly say some programmed sentences
 - have a face, presents feelings (maybe?)
 - learn the accent or personality of the user (maybe?)
-------------
afterall it might not be able to run smoothly in all computers but you can make sure its smarter than every other assistants and someone may actually use it in common unlike some assistant programs.
